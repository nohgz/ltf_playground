SpaceCharger v1.1

[ADDED]
-> Toggleable fit to electric fields- attempts to smoothen out numerical noise
-> Obtained the electric fields in both the lab mesh frame and comoving mesh frame [in progress]
-> Added a wrapper function for users to call the whole routine for a given bunch size
  o take particle bunch -> lorentz boost to comoving frame -> get eflds in comoving frame
    -> boost back to lab frame and get the fields there

-> new file called spacecharger_tiny.py, which is as slim as the routine will get. for use in multiple space charge field calculations
   all it does is take in an input file and return the E and B. that's it. There aren't even prog bars!

[CHANGES]
-> Modified the multiGaussFit routine to allow for exact numbers instead of close enough numbers [DONE]

[FIXES]
-> Improved logic and speed for the quadrature rules ( 150% speedup! )
-> Implemented different charge types, as it wasn't before. [DONE]
